A stylish digital clock that displays the current time and date dynamically. The clock updates every second and has a modern, responsive design.

## Features

- Shows the current day, date, month, and year
- Updates in real-time every second
- Stylish and responsive UI
- Animated hover effects

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Gradient backgrounds, hover effects)
- JavaScript (Dynamic time updates)

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open `Digital_Clock1.html` in a web browser.
3. The clock will start running automatically.

## File Structure

- `Digital_Clock1.html` - The main structure of the clock.
- `Digital_Clock2.css` - Styling for the clock with a modern UI.
- `Digital_Clock3.js` - JavaScript logic for updating time and date dynamically.

## How It Works

1. The JavaScript function `clock()` retrieves the current time and date.
2. It formats the time into `HH:MM:SS` format and displays it on the page.
3. The function runs every second using `setInterval(clock, 1000)`, ensuring real-time updates.
